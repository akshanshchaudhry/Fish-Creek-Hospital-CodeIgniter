# Fish-Creek-Hospital-CodeIgniter
A website created using PHP and MySQL database.  The MVC framework for PHP, CodeIgniter, is used to develop this website project.


I have just added the application and css folder because of the large size issue. The application and css folder contains all the important and required files of the project.
